### About Me

A couple of years ago, I decided to change job. I have chosen to work with websites because I like to see how my code turns the screen into something visual that everyone can understand. I often come across sites and applications that are inconvenient for the user, and it seems to me that I could learn to make sites better, more convenient.  
I am learning the basics of HTML/CSS-coding and Javascript. I want to work for an IT-company to be able to learn from the professionals who work in this field. I want to put this knowledge into practice and improve my programming skills.
